# Smart_Contract

## Background

Your new startup has created its own Ethereum-compatible blockchain to help connect financial institutions, and the team wants 
to build smart contracts to automate some company finances to make everyone's lives easier, increase transparency, and to make 
accounting and auditing practically automatic!
Fortunately, I've been learning how to program smart contracts with Solidity! What I will be doing this assignment is 
creating 2 `ProfitSplitter` contracts. These contracts will do the following things:

* Pay your Associate-level employees quickly and easily.

* Distribute profits to different tiers of employees.
